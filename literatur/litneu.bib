	abstract = {In the era of digitalization, understanding consumer behaviour has become paramount for effecting marketing and growth and expansion of any business. Approach of consumer behaviour towards E-marketing in multifaceted. Digital consumers are now more aware, informed, connected and empowered than ever before. The way a consumer discovers, evaluates and buy goods or services has been reshaped by proliferation of online platforms, social media and E-commerce. Marketers need to grasp the nuances of this contemporary behaviour of customers. Furthermore, the abstract emphasizes the role of technology in fostering consumerism, demand for instant gratification and personalized interactions and customization has been created by introducing technology. Consumers seek convenience, authenticity, quality and value which has encouraged the online businesses. This has increased the role of digital platforms in research comparison, data analysis and purchased decisions. This study gives the idea of changing the dynamics of consumerism in the digital age. Due to advanced and convenient technology, consumers are more attracting towards online shopping or E-commerce than offline shopping or retail marketing. This study also focuses on increasing use of digital platforms which include multiple choices of promotion or advertisement that shape consumer preferences and encourage their impulse buying behaviour. Not only the society but also the community as a whole get effected by contemporary consumerism. This study also explores the opportunities and problems that consumers of civil society face. They play a crucial role in growth of national economy.},

	abstract = {Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, people’s online and in-store shopping behaviors changed significantly. As the pandemic subsides, key questions are why those changes happened, whether they are expected to stay, and, if so, to what extent. We answered those questions by analyzing a quasi-longitudinal survey dataset of the Puget Sound residents (Washington, U.S.). We deployed structural equation modeling (SEM) to build separate models for food, grocery, and other items shopping to explore the factors affecting such changes. The results revealed that people’s online and in-store shopping frequencies during the pandemic were affected by their perceived health risk, attitudes toward shopping, and pre-pandemic shopping frequencies. Similarly, it was shown that how frequently people expect to shop post pandemic is influenced by their attitudes toward shopping, changes during the pandemic, and their pre-pandemic frequencies. We also classified respondents into five groups, based on their current and expected future shopping behavior changes, and performed a descriptive analysis. The five groups—
              Increasers
              ,
              Decreasers
              ,

              , and
              Future Changers
              —exhibited different trends across online and in-store activities for shopping different goods. The analysis results showed that, while 25\% of the respondents increased their online shopping, only 8\% to 13\% decreased their in-store activities, implying that online shopping did not completely substitute in-store shopping. Moreover, we found that online shopping is a substitution for in-store shopping for groceries, while it complements in-store shopping for food and other items. Additionally, more than 75\% of new online shoppers expect to keep purchasing online, while 63\%–85\% of in-store Decreasers plan to return to their pre-pandemic frequencies.},

	abstract = {With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing importance of e-commerce, the study of online consumer behavior is of particular relevance. The purpose of this study was to form a methodological approach to assess the relationships and the level of influence of the factors activating the purchasing behavior of online consumers against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research methodology was based on the transformation of Cattell’s questionnaire and the implementation of correlation analysis. To determine the predisposition of online consumer behavior at the time of making a purchase decision, this study used the questionnaire method. The survey was conducted among online shoppers in the top 10 countries in terms of e-commerce market growth. The scientific contribution is the proposed methodological toolkit to assess the purchasing behavior of online consumers, which identifies the most influential factors in their purchasing behavior and provides an opportunity to assess the dynamics of their activity during the study period, to identify key trends and determine changes in their behavior. The research revealed what changes in online consumer buying behavior are typical in the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of consumer awareness and experience has increased. Online consumers have become more experienced, which has influenced the activity of their buying behavior. This study proved the shifting influence of online consumer purchasing behavior factors during the pandemic. The increasing importance of the speed of decision making by consumers when purchasing goods and services online was determined.},

On the other hand, the consumer's need to see, touch and feel a product directly is only available in physical stores. This study aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail consumer behavior. This study uses quantitative methods with secondary data sources obtained from several countries including the United States, England, Germany, France, Canada and Latin America. The results show that the shopping trends during the COVID-19 pandemic are webrooming and pure online shopping. Retail sales data in these countries shows that retail sales in physical stores exceed 70\% of total retail sales and retail e-commerce sales are less than 30\% of total retail sales.

The membrane fragments contained very little phycocyanin and had excellent optical properties for spectrophotometric assays. With DCIPH2 as the electron donor, NADP+ had no effect on the light-induced redox changes of cytochromes: with or without NADP+, 715- or 664-nm illumination resulted mainly in the oxidation of cytochrome f and of other component(s) which may include a c-type cytochrome with an alpha peak at 549nm. With 664 nm illumination and water as the electron donor, NADP+ had a pronounced effect on the redox state of cytochromes, causing a shift toward oxidation of a component with a peak at 549 nm (possibly a c-type cytochrome), cytochrome f, and particularly cytochrome b559. Cytochrome b559 appeared to be a component of the main noncyclic electron transport chain and was photooxidized at physiological temperatures by Photosystem II. This photooxidation was apparent only in the presence of a terminal acceptor (NADP+) for the electron flow from water.},

            With the rising popularity of immersive virtual reality (iVR) technologies, retailers are increasingly seeking innovative ways to create unique digital shopping experiences for their consumers. However, existing literature lacks a unified and comprehensive review that examines the interplay between virtual stimuli and consumer behavior in iVR shopping environments. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review, employing the Stimulus‐Organisms‐Responses (S‐O‐R) model as the underlying theoretical framework. This review analyzed empirical research on consumer behavior in iVR retail environments by focusing on experimental studies. Following the thematic analysis, we categorized the outcomes into descriptive themes to better comprehend consumer behavior within each theme. Our findings provide valuable insights for retailers and marketers aiming to enhance the consumer shopping experience using iVR technologies and suggest directions for future research.},
